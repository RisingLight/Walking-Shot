- Here you can show what you have `learnt` thus far, ***compare*** it with others, seek help and get better
- You are welcome to give your own `problem statements` with or without solution.

# Guide

- **Project** is anything 'Working' in any language which tries to solve any problem.
	* Projects are Sub divided into **Web** , **Mobile** and **Desktop-Console**
	* ~~Adding 2 numbers~~ is not a Project , but to be able to do all arithmetic operations on any 2 given numbers is (`Calculator`)
	* You need to properly mention what you have used, and how to recreate it. 

- **Challenges** is any question solved/unsolved present in the Challenge.md, you 
	* There is no restriction of language, If you think you can solve a problem in a particular language. GO FOR IT!
		* Once you get satisfied by your code, and have made sure that it works. you should commit it as " Problem? O(?) B/I ".
			+ Where ? means number for the problem, then for the time complexity, and B/I means Best/Improve{ Best= this is the solution of all} {I = Can be Improved } 
			+ E.g " ~~Problem2~~ O(n^2) I " => this means, you have done Problem2 which works under the time complexity of n^2 which could be further improved.
			+ E.g " ~~Problem4~~ O(n^3) B " => this means, you have done Problem4 which works under the time complexity of n^3 which is the best result you can get by yourself. 	
	* Get creative with Questions
		* Eg-: Already Present question `Find a number in an array` you can add new spice to it by making it `Find a number in an array and what index it will take if the array gets sorted`
			* Give Further Test cases and explain what constraints you have put in your own modified problem
	* Follow the Problem order given in `Problem.md`, you can give all the detail in the challenge/Problem folder. 
	* Provide Multiple solution to a problem, be it O(n) or O(1), has high time complexity, or how you can optimize a O(n^3) to O(n)

- **Algo&DS** For those who wish to Brush up their DS and Algorithm can put them in this section
	* Only Well commented Code will get pushed to the Main branch, or any sort of proper explainnation 
	* Applying a `Adavance DS` to a Challenge Problem will give you a Badge of Elite instantly.{ commit it as B-DS or I-DS}, `DS used should be mention properly in comments`

## Team

> You can form teams as well, you need to have a picture which represnts you or an image which has names of all members , And name of the Active project

| **Team1** | **Team2** | **Team3** |

| `Project Alpha` | `Project Beta` | `Project Gamma` |

- Team needs to keep the project active.
- Project work should have a clear division among members.
